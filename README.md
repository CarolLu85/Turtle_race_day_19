# Turtle_race_day_19
my logic was: using the speed function with a random number as argument at the beginning. 
in this way, the winner is determined at the time when the speed is given, which isnt a real-lift situation.

in a race, the real race, no one knows who gets to win till the last second. 
the speed of the participants is unpredicatible at any stage of the race.
so to modify my code and make it more close to real-life situation, it would be better to use forward 
function.

right now, the most difficult part for me to do an OOP project is to identify all the variables.
it is really hard to tell which ones are objects, which ones are attributes now. i always got them messed up.
